<h2>How to Put Taminations on Your Web Site</h2>

<p>For web site authors, class teachers, and callers,
  you can put any animation or sequence on your web site.
  The basic concept is to set up an
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" target="_blank">iframe</a>,
  link it to a specific animation or sequence,
  and add the parameter &quot;embed&quot;.
  That tells Taminations to strip away everything except the
  animation and its controls.
</p>

<h3>Embed an Animation</h3>
<p>The quick and easy way is to view an animation in your browser
and copy the link.  Just click on the Share button and the link
is copied to the clipboard.  Paste it into your HTML page
as the source for your iframe, and append &quot;&amp;embed&quot;
to the end.</p>

<h3>Embed a Sequence</h3>
<p>The method is much the same as an animation.  Write your calls in
the sequencer, then copy the link with the Share button.
  The starting formation and all the
calls are in the link.  So then paste the link as the source
for your iframe, appending &quot;&amp;embed&quot;</p>

<h3>Additional Settings</h3>
<p>To automatically run an animation as soon as it's displayed,
add the &quot;Play&quot; parameter to the link.  In addition,
  you can add any setting from the Settings page.
  For checkbox settings, add  &lt;name&gt; or &lt;name&gt;=true
  to turn it on, &lt;name&gt;=false to force it off.  Other
  settings are set as &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;.
  Separate all parameters including these settings
  with ampersands.  Be sure to enter names and values exactly as on
  the Settings page, case and spacing are important.
