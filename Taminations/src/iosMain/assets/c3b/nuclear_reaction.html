<h2>Nuclear Reaction</h2>

<p>From a Generalized 1/4 Tag in which the Very Centers are directly facing an outside dancer.</p>

    <ol><li>Very Centers and directly-facing outside dancers Pass Thru;</li>
    <li>Center 4 Cast Off 1/4 and Roll and Spread to become Ends of Lines as the Others Cross Concentric Vertical 1/2 Tag;</li>
    <li>all Counter Rotate 1/4.</li></ol>

<p>Ends in Parallel Lines. This is a 3-part call.</p>

  <p><b>Cross Nuclear Reaction</b> Same as Nuclear Reaction except that the Very
  Centers Diagonal Pass Thru with the diagonally-facing outside dancers.</p>
