    <p>Double Pass Thru is a four-dancer call, but it is most commonly used from the eight-dancer formation of a Double Pass Thru (which is two side-by-side Facing Tandems).</p>
    <p>The Ocean Wave Rule applies to this call. That is, it can begin from a Right-Hand 1/4 Tag (or a Right-Hand Single 1/4 Tag).</p>
    <p>Except for applications of the Ocean Wave Rule, dancers must start facing each other, rather than offset. For
      example, Heads Star Thru, Boys Double Pass Thru is improper. However, &quot;Heads Star Thru, Boys On A Diagonal,
      Double Pass Thru&quot; is a proper extension and ends in Left-Hand Columns.</p>
