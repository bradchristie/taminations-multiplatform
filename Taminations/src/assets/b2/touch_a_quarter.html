  </div>

  <div class="comments">
    <p>From Facing Dancers, the call <a href="ocean_wave.html">Step To A Wave</a> gives a Right-Hand Mini-Wave.</p>
    <p>The Ocean Wave Rule does not apply to this call. Therefore, a combination like
      &quot;Swing Thru, All 8 Circulate, Touch 1/4&quot; is improper.</p>
    <p>The left-handed version of this call is Left Touch 1/4. See &quot;Additional Detail: Commands: Extensions like Reverse Wheel Around&quot;.</p>
