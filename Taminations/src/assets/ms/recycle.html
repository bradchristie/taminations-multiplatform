    As each End and adjacent Center begin to turn, they release their mini-wave handhold. They smoothly
    establish a couple handhold once they are approximately facing the same direction.</div>

    <p>The Facing Couples Rule does not apply.
      From Facing Couples, the call Recycle has a different
      definition that is not part of the Mainstream program.</p>
    <p>When teaching it may be helpful to prompt the action of the Centers
      as "Fold, follow, face" and to explain that
      the Centers walk almost a full circle to finish
      a small step back from where they started and beside the dancer
      they followed.</p></div>

The ends of the wave Cross Fold as the centers Fold in behind the ends and

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
The Ends’ part of the call feels like Wheel &amp; Deal.
The Centers’ part feels like &quot;Centers Run, then same dancers Fold&quot;.
Recycle should never be taught as &quot;Centers U-Turn Back then all Wheel &amp; Deal&quot;.
