    <p>From Facing Couples, the left-hand dancers take a full step back and to the right. This prepares for the Left Touch 1/4 while giving the right-hand dancers room to Right Pull By.</p>
    <p>From Facing Tandems, the trailers step slightly to the right to prepare for the Left Touch 1/4.</p>

  <div class="comments"><b>Comments</b>
    <p>The Ocean Wave Rule applies to this call (from a Single 1/4 Tag).</p>
    <p>From a Double Pass Thru, it is confusing to simply call Dixie Style to an Ocean Wave because of the following ambiguity: The center 4 could do the call starting from Facing Couples, or each Tandem could do the call with the Tandem they are facing. The caller should clarify by using extra words like:</p>
    <ul><li>Center 4, Dixie Style to a Wave, or</li>
      <li>On a Double Track (or "Single File" or "Each Column of 4"), Dixie Style to a Wave.</li></ul>
    <p>"Double Track" is used to describe two side-by-side Facing Tandems; some callers avoid this terminology when the Facing Tandems are end-to-end (i.e., a 1x8 formation with Facing Tandems on each side). Also see "Part 4: Additional Detail: Starting Formations".</p>
    <p>From a normal Squared Set, "All 4 Ladies Lead, Dixie Style to a Wave" is an extended application (and is likely to come after Four Ladies Chain). The Right Pull By is replaced by Right-Hand Star 1/2, similar to Four Ladies Chain. After the Left Touch 1/4, dancers end in a Thar with men in the center. Callers should expect to workshop this application.</p>

<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b>
From Facing Couples, the right-hand dancer steps forward and to the left to
become the lead dancer in a tandem. Lead dancers right pull by and Left
Touch &frac14; with the other trailing dancer. The new centers (original trailers)
join right hands to become centers of a Left Hand Ocean Wave.

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
The lead dancers start with hand shake hold and adjust to ocean wave styling
for turning and forming the left hand wave. The trailing dancers should adjust
their bodies by turning slightly to the right and have their hands in
&quot;Ready Dancing Position&quot; in order to receive the lead dancer coming toward them.
