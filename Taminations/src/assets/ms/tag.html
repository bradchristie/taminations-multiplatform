right shoulders with oncoming dancers until they have walked past all of the
dancers from the other half of the line. The call may be followed by any one
of the directions In, Out, Right or Left. When this happens, dancers turn in
place one quarter (90&deg;) in the direction indicated.

	<b>Comments</b>
	<p>Tag The Line is a 4-dancer call. From a General Line of 8, the
		phrase “Each Side” (or “Each Four”) is helpful but not required.</p>
	<p>After Tag The Line, the direction In (or Out) means to turn
		toward (or away from) the center of the set. From General Lines, Tag
		The Line, Face In (or Out) ends in Facing Lines (or Lines
		Back-to-Back).</p>
	<p>The direction given does not have to be the same for all
		dancers, e.g., Tag The Line, Boys Face Left, Girls Face Right.</p>
	<p>An extended application of Tag The Line begins from a General
		Line containing six or eight dancers. The caller must explicitly
		identify the line, e.g., “Line of Eight, Tag The Line”. The
		application from a line of two dancers is improper at Mainstream; it
		has a separate name and is in another program.</p>
