    <p>Walk and Dodge is a four-dancer call.
      From Columns, dancers work in two groups of four,
      one on each side, ending in a Trade By formation.</p>
    <p>As a gimmick, callers may designate some dancers
      to back up rather than &quot;walking&quot;. For example,
      Heads Square Thru, Touch 1/4, Walk and Dodge,
      Girls Back Up and Boys Dodge. From Lines Facing Out,
      the command Centers Walk, Ends Dodge is also a gimmick,
      as are other applications where dancers leave their group of four.
      See &quot;Additional Detail: Commands: Gimmicks&quot;.</p>
    <p>There are extended applications in which six or eight dancers
      work together. For example, after Sides Pass the Ocean,
      Sides Swing thru, All Boys Run, it is possible to either have
      the Center 6 Walk and Dodge or the Outside 6 Walk and Dodge.
      In both cases, four dancers &quot;walk&quot; and two dancers &quot;dodge&quot;.
      It is also possible to have six dancers &quot;walk&quot; and two dancers "dodge".
      For example, Heads Touch 1/4, Side Girls Dodge and Others Walk.</p>
    <p>From Facing Couples or Back-to-Back Couples, the command
      &quot;Walk and Dodge&quot; by itself is improper unless dancers are
      expected to do their part (see Additional Detail: Commands: Do Your Part).</p>

From box circulate formation, each dancer facing into the box walks forward
to take the place of the dancer who was directly in front of him/her.
Meanwhile, each dancer facing out of the box steps sideways (dodges)
into the position vacated by the &quot;walker&quot; who was formerly beside him/her.
Dancers end side by side, both facing out. If walk and dodge is called from
facing couples, the caller must designate who is to walk and who is to dodge
(e.g., &quot;men walk, ladies dodge&quot;).

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Calling Tip</b>
Be careful when using this call as some calls don't flow well or feel good
after a Walk and Dodge (e.g., &quot;Walk and Dodge, Bend the Line&quot; or
&quot;Walk and Dodge, Wheel and Deal&quot; are not good body flow for half of the dancers).
