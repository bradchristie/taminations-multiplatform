    Centers Turn 1/2. In the center Ocean Wave, each end and adjacent center Turn 3/4.</div>

    <p>The Facing Couples Rule applies to this call.</p>
    <p>While the new centers are finishing the call, the resulting ends may be given another call (e.g., Spin Chain
      Thru; Ends Circulate Twice).</p>
    <p>Spin Chain Thru can be danced as &quot;All Turn 1/2.
      Those who meet Turn 3/4. Those who meet Turn 1/2. Those
      who meet Turn 3/4&quot;.
      With this in mind, some callers use Spin Chain Thru
      from an Alamo Ring as a gimmick
      (see &quot;Additional Detail: Commands: Gimmicks&quot;).
      When using this gimmick, callers must indicate which pairs
      of dancers begin the call, e.g.,
      &quot;Start with the Right and Spin Chain Thru.&quot;</p>

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Calling Tip</b>
A good flowing combination is to have the Ends Circulate Twice while the centers are working.
</div>

<div class="teaching-tip"><b>Teaching Tip</b>
Teach the Spin Concept action like in Spin The Top, i.e.: End and adjacent
center turn one half (180 degrees) and new centers turn or cast three quarters (270 degrees).
