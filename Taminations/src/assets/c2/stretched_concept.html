<h2>Stretched (Formation) Concept</h2>
<p>From a tidal line or wave: The people marked the same (dots and slashes) work
together and do the call. The centers move over to work with the ends, and
finish the call near them. This adjustment is done during the first part of the
call, rather than being done before the call starts. </p>
