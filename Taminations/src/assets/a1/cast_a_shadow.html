<h2>Cast a Shadow</h2>

    <p>From the following formations only:</p>
    <ul><li>2x4 with the ends forming a tandem</li>
        <li>Promenade or Wrong Way Promenade</li></ul>

    <p>From a 2x4 formation with the ends forming a tandem: ends &frac12;
<a href="../b2/zoom.html">Zoom</a>, <a href="../ms/turn_thru.html">Arm Turn</a> &frac34;,
and <a href="../plus/anything_and_spread.html">Spread</a>,
to become ends of a 2x4. Meanwhile centers
facing out <a href="../ms/cloverleaf.html"> Cloverleaf</a> and centers facing in
<a href="../plus/extend.html">Extend</a>, Arm Turn 1/4,
and Extend. The centers finish as centers of a 2x4 by stepping in between ends who spread
        apart.  In the case in which all the centers are facing in, they <a href="pass_in.html"> Pass In</a> and <a href="../b1/pass_thru.html">Pass Thru</a>; if all centers are
            facing out, they Cloverleaf.</p>

<p>From Promenade or Wrong Way Promenade: The caller must designate two couples, e.g., Heads Cast a Shadow.
Everyone acts as though the formation were two-faced lines, with the designated couples as
the leads. Thus, the outsides do a &frac12; Zoom
(with the designated outside acting as the lead), Arm Turn &frac34;, and Spread, while the
designated centers <a href="../ms/cloverleaf.html">Cloverleaf</a>,
and the other centers Hinge and Extend. Ends in parallel
waves.</p>
<p>Note: Cast a Shadow is not proper from Columns because the ends are not in tandem with each other.</p>
