  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h3>Entering Calls</h3>
  <p>Enter calls by typing into the edit box at the upper left.
    Case is not important.  The sequencer recognizes common
    synonyms, such as 2/two, through/thru, and will adjust
    plurals as needed.  Calls are not case-sensitive.
  </p>
  <p>Erase the last call with the Undo button or by typing "undo".
    To erase the current sequence and start a new one, tap the
    Reset button or type "reset".</p>
  <p>To add a comment, just type a line starting with anything
    except a letter or number.</p>

  <h3>Copy and Paste</h3>
  <p>You can transfer your sequences between a text file with Copy and Paste.
  </p>

  <h3>Share</h3>
  <p class="dom">Copies a link to the clipboard that includes the sequence.</p>

  <h3>Abbreviations</h3>
  <p>There is a built-in list of abbreviations.  You can edit this list
  to change and add your own abbreviations. Abbreviations
  cannot be a word used in real calls, and cannot include spaces.  Pressing
  <code>Return</code> saves your abbreviation.  If your abbreviation is
    highlighted red it is in error, either it has a space or is a duplicate.
    To delete an abbreviation just clear it, don't forget to press
    <code>Return</code>.  Press the Abbreviations button to re-sort
    and remove blanks.
    All the abbreviations are stored between sessions.</p>

  <h3>What the Sequencer Can Do</h3>

  <p>There are two ways the sequencer figures out how to do a call:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It first looks for an exact match for the call and formation in the illustrated animations.  For calls like Star Thru genders must also match.</li>
    <li>If an exact match is not found, it looks for code specific for that call
        which can compute the animation for any appropriate formation.
        This includes concept calls programmed to work together with other calls.
        Many calls are coded this way, and are indexed below.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Coded Calls Index</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Basic 1</li>
    <li>Basic 2</li>
    <li>Mainstream</li>
    <li>Plus</li>
    <li><a href="sequencer-a1.html">A-1</a></li>
    <li>A-2</li>
    <li><a href="sequencer-c1.html">C-1</a></li>
    <li><a href="sequencer-c2.html">C-1</a></li>
    <li>C-3A</li>
    <li>C-3B</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Any call illustrated in Taminations can be used if the formation matches.
    In addition, some simple calls and modifiers are programmed so they can be
    used in any appropriate formation.  These include
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Designators:</b> Boys/Girls, Beaus/Belles, Leaders/Trailers, Ends/Centers/Very Centers, Facing Dancers, Outer 2/4/6, Center 2/4/6<br/>
    Heads/Sides - in a squared set, refers to dancers in those positions.
      Otherwise, the original heads or sides.
    </li>
    <li><b>Calls:</b> Run/Cross Run, Face In/Out/Left/Right, Quarter In/Out,
      Pass Thru, Slip, Slide Thru, Turn Back, Wheel Around, Zig/Zag</li>
    <li><b>Modifiers and Concepts:</b> Roll, Spread</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are some special calls and keywords you can use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Square the Set - all dancers go straight home</li>
    <li>Back Away - use this after calls like Heads Right and Left Thru if you do not want the dancers to stay in the center</li>
    <li>Step Ahead</li>
    <li>Slide In/Out/Left/Right</li>
    <li>&lt;anything&gt; once and a half (or 1 1/2)</li>
    <li>Those Who Can - Several simple calls such as Pass Thru, Slide Thru, and Touch a Quarter can be prepended with Those Who Can</li>
    <li>&lt;anything&gt; twice</li>
    <li>Half &lt;anything&gt;</li>
    <li>Undo - removes the most recent call</li>
    <li>Reset - clears the current sequence</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>What the Sequencer Cannot Do</h3>
  <p>Except for the simple programmed calls listed above, the sequencer can only
    do calls that it can find in Taminations.  For example, it will not do
    Dosado from waves because there's no animation for that.</p>
  <p>The sequencer does not know much about Challenge concepts.  There
    are several other programs that are much better at writing Challenge
    choreography.</p>

  <h3>This is a New Feature</h3>
  <p>Any and all <a href="mailto:brad@bradchristie.com?Subject=Taminations%20sequencer">feedback</a> is appreciated.  You may find
    things that don't work right.  Also feel free to let me know features you would
    like added next.</p>
